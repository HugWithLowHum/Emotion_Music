    <p>
      <span class="i">No Man's Sky</span> is a space exploring game that has 18
      quintillion procedurally generated planets, each has its unique minerals,
      flora, terrain, etc. The developers wanted to create a game that leaves
      players infinite worlds to explore. This idea was also reflected by the
      game's background music, created by the music group
      <span class="i">65daysofstatic</span>. You will never hear the exact same
      piece of music twice in the game. Instead, the music you hear will always
      be modifications of several motifs. The music changes according to the
      player's environment, behavior, and status. For instance, the music on a
      freezing planet with monsters that hunt the player might share similar
      melodic idea with the music on a peaceful earth-like planet, but the
      former will sound more intense and unsettling.

      music that reflects the user's emotion. User may input their emotional
      state by selecting a point on the
